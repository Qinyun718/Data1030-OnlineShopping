### The balance of the dataset
- balance: the fraction of data points that belong to the most populous class
- the balance of the classification problem is the first thing you should check!
- it gives a baseline accuracy score
    - the simplest classifier that predicts class 0 to all points is correct 75.9% of the time
    - a classification model has predictive power if it is  more accurate than the baseline
- it can guide what evaluation metric should be used
    - imbalanced problems: most points belong to class 0
       - accuracy is not a good metric because the baseline is high
